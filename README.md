# About the Project
## Information
![BinaryConverterShowcase2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65184258/101662192-1c7a6280-3a41-11eb-9765-8c26c45de68f.gif)

This project is an updated version of my Binary Converter. Instead of using Tkinter, I have used PySide2 to make a more modern design.
I will start using PySide2 and PyQt5 for my future projects.

The program supports live Binary to Text and Text to Binary conversion as you are typing. There are still quite a few bugs which I am looking to fix so the program can be fully functional, however, the intended features are available!

Please see [changelog](https://github.com/RealKevinApetrei/Binary-Converter-2/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for details on updates.

**DISCLAIMER: This program is still in *BETA* and may have certain bugs. Minimal features are available.**\
